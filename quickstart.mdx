## Get started in three steps

Get your documentation site running locally and make your first customization.

### Step 1: Set up your tkens

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Add your first tken." icon="copy">
    At first, when you open the [dashboard](https://paradise.wasmer.app/), you will be provided with 4 options and in those 4 button options, you will have to press Setup. It'll take you to a page where you would be prompted to add your account (tken) and an alias (a nickname for the tken). Once you fill in both fields, you can press continue.

    If you ever want to delete or re-add it, you can always go back to the tken page and press delete and do the process again. Same for another tken, go to the tken page and press on "add tken" and do the process again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Start the bot" icon="rectangle-terminal">
    Once you've added everything necessary, you will be redirected to the actual dashboard, in which you can press "Start," and that will automatically start the bot.

    <Tip>
      The bot automatically adjusts to the changes you make on the dashboard.

</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Set up Extras.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Setup MDM" icon="github">
    As we all know, you are most likely here for the mdm feature. This will teach you how to use it.

    1. When you open the dashboard, you have to scroll down till you see categories for the bot. In that section, the category "MDM" will be visible. Then, you click it.
    2.  Once you click the category, the MDM menu will open, where you can specify how many users you want it to send to and what message you want it to send. Optionally, you can put any user id's which you want to be excluded.
    3.  Once it starts, it will send the messages accordingly. Also, when it finishes, it will say on the dashboard how many users it could send to and how many it couldn't.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom Rich Presence (RP)" icon="palette">
    To set up the Rich Presence, you have to go to the**Custom Rich Presence**  category in the dashboard. Once it is opened, you will follow these steps:

    1. Select the activity you want to display. (E.g. playing, streaming, etc...)
    2. Specify a title for it to display. (e.g. dancing to 6lack)
    3. In the Large Image field, paste a link to an image you want associated with your**RP.** 
    4. Press save, and watch it automatically update your profile. 

    <Tip>
      The bot must be started for it to update; otherwise, it'll update after the bot starts.
